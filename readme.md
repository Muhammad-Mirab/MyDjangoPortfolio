# ☘️ MyDjangoPortfolio
this is the ongoing project of my portfolio website and it's using Naem Azam's template...☘️

the website that I'm working on will be open-sourced and will be fully editable(info and contact informations and projects) from the django admin dashboard, if I have the energy and time needed I will add an exclusive dashboard for admin...
## 🎨 Design
the template used in the project is from this [repo](https://github.com/naemazam/UXUI-portfolio) by Naem Azam, I'll try getting in touch with him to discuss about the blog section also if anyone is interested in adding things to the ui or the backend feel free to notify me!
## 🚀 About Me
I'm an Embedded software engineer who is also looking forward to starting a team of young and talented developer and designers to use the team's capacities in order to further improve our society's knowledge in IT department...

I'm also into python and telegram bot development so if you have any idea that you think can be a good open-source(or closed) project hit me up :)
